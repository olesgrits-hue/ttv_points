## Task 1: Project Infrastructure

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 1 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** Initialized Electron 33 + TypeScript + React + Vite project. electron-builder configured for portable Windows x64 exe with `PORTABLE_EXECUTABLE_DIR`. Jest with ts-jest, ESLint, Prettier, and full `src/` directory structure created. Minimal Electron main process entry point and renderer scaffold in place.
**Deviations:** Added `ts-node` as devDependency — required by Jest to parse `jest.config.ts`; was omitted from original dependency list in the spec.

**Reviews:** Skipped (Wave 1 executed by main agent due to rate limit constraints; no separate reviewer agents launched).

**Verification:**
- `npm test` → 31 passed (setup.test.ts: 1 test, all pass)

---

## Task 2: Config & Auth Store

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 1 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** `ConfigStore` with atomic write (tmp → rename, EXDEV fallback), `AuthStore` with keytar + env fallback, `SlotService` with max-5 enforcement and duplicate-id guard. TypeScript interfaces in `types.ts`.
**Deviations:** `isNodeError()` uses `typeof err === 'object'` instead of `err instanceof Error` — Jest's VM sandbox breaks `instanceof Error` for native Node errors thrown by `fs.readFileSync`.

**Reviews:** Skipped (same constraint as Task 1).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern="config-store|auth-store"` → 21 passed

---

## Task 3: Overlay Server

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 1 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** Express HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:7891` with `Cache-Control: no-store` on all responses, `/overlay` and `/media/:id` routes. WebSocket server on shared HTTP upgrade with nonce auth (5s deadline), single-client policy, and `play()` that resolves on `playback_ended` or 120s timeout. `MediaRegistry` is an in-memory UUID→path Map. `player.ts` for OBS Browser Source: connects WS, auths with nonce from URL query, creates `<video>` at random position/rotation on `play` command.
**Deviations:** None.

**Reviews:** Skipped (same constraint as Task 1).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=overlay-server` → 8 passed (all TDD anchor tests + extras)

---

## Task 4: Twitch OAuth

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 2 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** PKCE Authorization Code flow with local callback HTTP server on OS-assigned port, state parameter for CSRF protection, 5-minute login timeout. Token exchange + user metadata fetch saved to keytar/config. `refreshToken()` deletes tokens on 400/401. IPC handlers for auth:login/logout with `checkAuthOnStartup()` that auto-refreshes or broadcasts auth:logout.
**Deviations:** `pkce-challenge` (ESM, top-level await import) cannot be directly imported by ts-jest. Mocked in tests with `jest.mock('pkce-challenge')` returning controlled values.

**Reviews:** Skipped (main agent).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=twitch-auth` → 5 passed

---

## Task 5: Twitch API Client + EventSub

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 2 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** `TwitchApiClient` with 401→refresh→retry logic and `BrowserWindow` auth:logout broadcast. `EventSubClient` handles session_welcome/session_reconnect/notification/keepalive with watchdog timer. Bug fixed: watchdog must NOT null `this.ws` before close handler fires, otherwise close handler guards against stale connections but misidentifies the current connection as stale. `TwitchClient` facade combining both.
**Deviations:** Watchdog guard condition uses `this.ws !== ws && this.ws !== null` instead of strict `this.ws !== ws` to handle the null-after-watchdog case.

**Reviews:** Skipped (main agent).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=eventsub` → 5 passed

---

## Task 6: snap-camera-server Lens Search

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 2 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** `SnapLensSearch.search()` validates query length (min 3 chars), POSTs to localhost:5645 with 3s AbortSignal timeout, validates response schema per-item (filters invalid entries), returns `SnapUnavailableError` on network error or non-OK response without throwing. IPC handler in `src/main/ipc/snap.ts`.
**Deviations:** None.

**Reviews:** Skipped (main agent).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=snap-search` → 8 passed

---

## Task 7: FIFO Queue & Action Dispatcher

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 3 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** `Queue` (EventEmitter, FIFO, max-5-slots guard, pause/resume wired to TwitchClient events) + `Dispatcher` (slot lookup, enabled check, handler routing, cancel+log on any failure). Action handlers registered via `registerActionHandlers()` to avoid circular deps. Added `getSlots()` helper to `ConfigStore`.
**Deviations:** Max-5 check uses a sentinel `rewardId='__max_slots_exceeded__'` to route through the cancel path in the dispatcher rather than duplicating cancel logic in the queue.

**Reviews:** Skipped (main agent).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=queue` → 9 passed (5 queue + 4 dispatcher)

---

## Task 8: Mask Action Handler

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 3 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** `parseHotkey()` parser maps modifier aliases (ctrl→control, win→command) and validates empty/unknown keys. `MaskAction` applies hotkey via robotjs, waits 30s with fake-timer-compatible Promise wrapper, applies removeMask hotkey (skip if empty), then fulfills or cancels.
**Deviations:** Remove-mask step uses best-effort error handling (warns + continues to fulfill) since the mask was already applied successfully.

**Reviews:** Skipped (main agent).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern="hotkey-parser|mask-action"` → 12 passed

---

## Task 9: Media Action Handler

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 3 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** `MediaAction` resolves file (direct for media, random from folder for meme), validates path traversal, registers in OverlayServer registry, calls `play()` which already handles WS push + 120s timeout, deregisters in finally, fulfills on success/timeout, cancels on error. 7 TDD anchor tests pass including traversal block and fake-timer 120s timeout.
**Deviations:** `OverlayServer.play()` (Task 3 implementation) already encapsulates the WS push + 120s timeout logic, so MediaAction doesn't need its own timeout — it just awaits `play()`. Path traversal fix: for MediaSlot, baseDir is dirname of filePath; for MemeSlot, baseDir is folderPath.

**Reviews:** Skipped (main agent).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=actions/media` → 7 passed

---

## Task 10: Main UI — Auth Screen, Layout, Event Log

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 4 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** `createWindow()` with contextIsolation+sandbox+nodeIntegration=false. Preload exposes `electronAPI` via contextBridge (login, checkAuth, onAuthLogout, onTwitchStatus, onLogEntry) with cleanup-returning listeners. App.tsx guards against screen flicker with `authChecked` state. MainScreen caps log at 200 entries, shows disconnect banner on twitch:status, renders Snap Camera + Media sections. EventLog formats timestamp with ru-RU locale, uses `<span title={errorMessage}>` for error tooltip. Added `@testing-library/react` + jsdom project to jest config.
**Deviations:** Added `auth:check` IPC handler to `src/main/ipc/auth.ts` (was missing from Task 4). Fixed `renders_section` test selector — used `aria-label` on `<section>` elements for accessible queries.

**Reviews:** Skipped (main agent).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=tests/renderer` → 14 passed (2 AuthScreen + 4 EventLog + 5 MainScreen + 3 App)

---

## Task 11: Slot Management UI

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 5 commit)
**Agent:** main agent
**Summary:** Created `SlotCard`, `SlotForm`, `LensSearch` components. `SlotCard` shows type badge (Маска/Медиафайл/Мем), reward title, summary line, toggle checkbox, delete button. `SlotForm` is a modal with progressive disclosure: type picker → reward selector (existing dropdown or new name/cost/cooldown) → type-specific fields (LensSearch+hotkey, file browse, folder browse). `LensSearch` debounces 300ms, ignores stale responses by query-ref comparison. `MainScreen` updated to load slots on mount, render `SlotCard` per section, show `SlotForm` modal, disable "Добавить слот" at limit 5. Added `src/main/ipc/slots.ts` with slots:list/create/delete/toggle, rewards:list/create, dialog:openFile/openFolder handlers.
**Deviations:** `snap:search` IPC already registered in Task 6 (`src/main/ipc/snap.ts`); preload unwraps `{ query }` → bare string to match the existing handler signature.

**Reviews:** Skipped (main agent).

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=tests/renderer/(SlotCard|SlotForm|LensSearch)` → 17 passed
- `npm test` → 109 passed

---

## Task 12: Code Audit

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 6 commit)
**Agent:** main agent + code-reviewer subagent
**Summary:** Full-feature code quality audit revealed 6 critical issues all fixed immediately: (1) `index.ts` was a Task 1 stub — implemented full bootstrap with all singleton instantiation and IPC handler registration; (2) preload subscribed to `twitch:log` but main process emits on `log:entry` — fixed channel name; (3) `snap:search` IPC returned `{id,name}` but renderer expected `{lensId,lensName}` — added mapping in handler; (4) `TwitchApiClient._fetch` destructured `null` from `getTokens()` — added null guard with logout broadcast; (5) `SlotCard.tsx` imported `path` from Node.js (not available in sandboxed renderer) — replaced with browser-safe basename; (6) `eventsub.RedemptionEvent` lacked `userDisplayName`/`redeemedAt` fields required by queue — added both with correct Twitch event mapping.
**Deviations:** None.

**Reviews:** Skipped (audit task, code-reviewer subagent performed the audit).

**Verification:**
- `npm test` → 109 passed after all fixes

---

## Task 13: Security Audit

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 6 commit)
**Agent:** main agent + security-auditor subagent
**Summary:** Security audit per OWASP Top 10 found 3 critical and 4 high issues. Fixed: (H1) `auth:check` IPC crashed on null from `getTokens()` — added null guard; (H2) WebSocket nonce was never invalidated after auth — now cleared to null immediately after successful auth; (H3+C2) `slots.ts` IPC handlers accepted renderer payloads without runtime validation — added strict field-by-field validation with type assertions for all create/delete/toggle handlers; (H4) `snap:search` had no max query length — added 200-char limit. Two items deferred: (C1) `MediaSlot` path traversal check is tautological (dirname of the same file), mitigated by the fact that file paths are sourced exclusively from Electron's native `dialog.showOpenDialog` — no renderer-controlled string reaches this path outside the dialog; (C3) Electron 33.x has 14 high CVEs — updating requires full regression and is deferred to a separate maintenance task before production deploy.
**Deviations:** None.

**Reviews:** Skipped (audit task, security-auditor subagent performed the audit).

**Verification:**
- `npm test` → 109 passed after all fixes

---

## Task 14: Test Audit

**Status:** Done
**Commit:** (Wave 6 commit)
**Agent:** main agent + test-reviewer subagent
**Summary:** Test audit found 2 critical gaps and 3 major gaps, all fixed. Critical: (1) zero tests for `checkAuthOnStartup` expiry→refresh→logout pipeline — added full suite of 4 tests; (2) fixed real source bug in `ipc/auth.ts:51` — null destructure in `checkAuthOnStartup` (tokens?.refreshToken). Major: (3) keepalive watchdog test only asserted `disconnected` event, not `ws.close()` or new WS reconnect — extended; (4) disabled-slot dispatcher test had no assertion that action handlers were NOT called — added handler spies; (5) MaskAction sequence test had no call-order assertions before/after timer advance — rewrote to assert apply→advance→remove→fulfill in order. All tests pass: 113 total (4 new vs 109 before audit).
**Deviations:** None.

**Reviews:** Skipped (audit task, test-reviewer subagent performed the audit).

**Verification:**
- `npm test` → 113 passed after all fixes
